         <h2>Javascript Popularity</h2> 

      <p>Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about it is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!

        Another advantage of learning JavaScript as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JS community on sites like Stack Overflow, so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn.
        
        Not only is it beginner-friendly; it will also set you up with some extremely valuable transferable skills. JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming—skills which can be transferred to any new language you might learn later on, such as Python, Java, or C++. JavaScript provides a crucial introduction to key principles and practices that you’ll take with you throughout your career as a developer.</p>
